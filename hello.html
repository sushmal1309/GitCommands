        <p>
            Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to 
            very large projects with speed and efficiency.
            Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. 
            It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, 
            convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.
